# Bar Station Trainer

## Overview

The Bar Station Trainer is a full-stack cocktail training application that simulates a realistic bar environment. It allows users to practice making cocktails by selecting ingredients from different bar sections and provides feedback on their selections. The application features a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for global state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for server state management

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: In-memory storage (MemStorage class)
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with `/api` prefix

### Key Design Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared schema between client and server using TypeScript
- **Component-Based UI**: Modular React components for bar sections and game elements
- **Game State Management**: Redux for complex game state with ingredients and feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first responsive design

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
1. **BarStation**: Main container showing the bar layout with back bar and front bar sections
2. **BackBar**: Top shelf spirits organized in rows with visual bottle representations
3. **FrontBar**: Speed line, mixers, and garnish sections for quick access ingredients
4. **BuildArea**: Ingredient selection and cocktail building interface
5. **CocktailDisplay**: Shows current cocktail challenge with recipe toggle
6. **FeedbackArea**: Provides success/failure feedback with detailed messages

### Backend Components
1. **Storage Interface**: Abstraction layer for data operations (currently in-memory)
2. **Route Handler**: Express route registration system
3. **Vite Integration**: Development server with hot module replacement

### Shared Components
1. **Schema Definitions**: Zod schemas for ingredients, cocktails, and game state
2. **Type Exports**: Shared TypeScript interfaces

## Data Flow

### Game Flow
1. User loads the application ‚Üí Random cocktail is selected
2. User clicks ingredients from bar sections ‚Üí Ingredients added to build area
3. User can modify amounts and remove ingredients
4. User submits cocktail ‚Üí Validation against correct recipe
5. Feedback displayed ‚Üí User can try again or get new challenge

### State Management
- **Redux Store**: Manages current cocktail, selected ingredients, and feedback state
- **Local Component State**: Handles UI interactions and form inputs
- **Server State**: TanStack Query manages API calls and caching

### Data Persistence
- **Development**: In-memory storage for rapid prototyping
- **Production Ready**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL schema defined

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript support
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit + React Redux
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui component library
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with Neon PostgreSQL driver
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Build**: esbuild for production bundling

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with React plugin
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across the stack
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration
- **Development**: Hot reload and error overlay

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite compiles React app to static files
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code with external dependencies
3. **Database Migration**: Drizzle kit handles schema migrations

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: `NODE_ENV=development` with local database
- **Production**: `NODE_ENV=production` with DATABASE_URL configuration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variables

### Deployment Commands
- `npm run dev`: Development server with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Production build for both client and server
- `npm run start`: Production server startup
- `npm run db:push`: Database schema synchronization
